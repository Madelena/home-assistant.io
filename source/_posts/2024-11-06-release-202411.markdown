<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.

## Sections dashboard no longer experimental!

This release marks a big milestone in our pursuit to making dashboards easier to customize and use for everyone, aka [Project Grace](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/)! The sections view layout, together with its drag-and-drop üê≤ capabilities and responsive design, is now out of experimental phase, and ready for primetime! This means that, as of this release, when you create a new dashboard, you will get our awesome feature-rich and easy-to-use dashboard editing experience.

Over the past few months, we worked hard to iterate and listen to your feedback to ensure that our new dashboard is easy to customize for both beginners and advanced users alike. We had added new capabilities such as [resizing cards](/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/), [visibility options](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/), [wider sections](/blog/2024/09/04/release-20249/), [new badges](/blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/) and most recently, adding [the new heading card](/blog/2024/10/02/release-202410/).

To finish up this journey, we are adding two more features in this release:

### Convert your old dashboards to sections view layout

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections" src="/images/blog/2024-11/dashboard-conversion.png"/>Screenshots showing the conversion of a view in masonry into sections</p>

This release includes a way to convert the old masonry view layout to the new sections view layout for your individual dashboard views. When you change the view type to sections, you get a button to convert the view. All the cards of the old view are then copied and placed in an imported cards section in the new view, and you can then easily drag-and-drop them into right sections.

Please note that cards placed within the imported cards section are not visible to users until they are moved to a section above the fold. This ensures that cards do not get accidentally shown in the wrong sections while you are still working on the dashboard.

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the imported cards section" src="/images/blog/2024-11/imported-cards.png"/>Screenshot of the imported cards section</p>

If you are not ready for the new layout yet, no worries! Your old dashboard view is kept when a new dashboard is created, giving an excellent way for masonry view veterans to try out sections while keeping all the hard work they have put into customizing their cards.

Alternatively, you can also move each card one-by-one from another view. All moved cards will also be temporarily placed in the imported cards section.

### Precise mode for card sizes

<p class='img no-shadow'><img class="no-shadow" alt="Examples of cards using precise mode" src="/images/blog/2024-11/precise-mode-example.png" style="width: 60%;"/>Examples of cards using precise mode</p>

If you love tinkering your dashboards and fine-tuning the card sizes with more precision, you now have even more control over the size of cards. In the layout options of a card you can now enable ‚ÄúPrecise mode‚Äù, which will give you 3 times more options for the width of cards!

Precise mode is applied on a card-by-card level. While a normal section is divided into 4 columns, precise modes gives you 12 columns, which allows you to align 2, 3, 4, or 6 buttons side-by-side.

## Low latency cameras using WebRTC

Camera streams will now try to use WebRTC whenever possible. WebRTC is an online standard that makes a peer-to-peer connection for lower-latency audio and video streaming. When you‚Äôre away from home, it will try to find the fastest and most direct path between your Home Assistant instance and the device you‚Äôre using.

The Open Home Foundation will host the basic network infrastructure to give all Home Assistant users the capability to use WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections whenever possible. Sometimes, a direct connection between the client and the camera is not possible; in those situations, the stream needs to be relayed by an external server. [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) now provides this relay server, and it's included as one of the many benefits available to subscribers! So, no matter where you are, you should always be able to watch your cameras via this low-latency technology.

If WebRTC is not available, it will fall back to using the old method of streaming.

{% enddetails %}

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Local file]**, done by [@gjohansson-ST]
- **[Onkyo]**, done by [@Nebula83]
- **[Smarty]**, done by [@joostlek]

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **Bloomsky**. Their service shut down.
- **Google Domains**. The domain registration service by Google has been
  shut down.
- **Spider**. The service is no longer available.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- [Image entities] now have a snapshot action, allowing you to save the current
  image in the entity to a file. Nice [@NickM-27]!
- [@Petro31] added [(limited) template] support to the "at" field of [time triggers].
  This allows you to template the time of that trigger in, for example,
  a blueprint automation.
- [Nautical miles] (`nmi`) is now a valid distance unit. This means you can now
  use this as a unit for your distance sensors. Thanks [@mib1185]!
- [@tetele] added [blueprints for template entities]! This allows for easier
  re-use and sharing of common blueprints for sets of templated entities.
  This feature is an advanced feature and is only available using manual YAML
  configuration.
- [@MindFreeze] and [@matthiasdebaat] had improved the network settings UI. You 
  can now see the Netmask of the network interfaces easier.

### Live logs

A bit technical maybe, but if you need to view the Home Assistant supervisor logs, you
can now view those live! No need to press refresh buttons anymore, and you can scroll back in time to see previous log items.

_**Insert recording of it streaming**_

### Assist for Canadian French

When we started Year of the Voice in early 2023, we took the decision to split French and Canadian French into two separate languages. This decision was unique because we hadn't done this for any other language spoken in more than one country.

Unfortunately, the Canadian French sentences stopped being updated, and a lot of new features never got implemented, such as timers, floor support, and area awareness, to name a few.
This release, we took the decision to merge both languages, this means that Canadian French users are getting a ton of great new voice features!

![Screenshot showing a few commands in Canadian French before and after this release](/images/blog/2024-11/canadian-french-on-assist.png)

French language leaders (@piitaya and @jlpouffier) are still looking for a Canadian French volunteer to help them with the French sentences, feel free to ping them if you are interested!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "A. O. Smith" %}

A. O. Smith now provides the hot water status as a percentage rather than low,
medium, or high. The hot water status entity has been updated accordingly.

([@bdr99] - [#127678]) ([documentation](/integrations/aosmith))

[@bdr99]: https://github.com/bdr99
[#127678]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127678

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Calendar" %}

Google Calendar events that are declined are now omitted from the calendar.

([@joelhawksley] - [#128900]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@joelhawksley]: https://github.com/joelhawksley
[#128900]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128900

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

Historically, many integrations implemented doorbells as binary sensors with a
device class of occupancy. This design was replaced with the new event entities,
which use a purpose-built device class of doorbell.

HomeKit will no longer automatically link binary sensors with device class
occupancy as linked doorbell sensors. However, linked doorbell sensors can
continue to be configured manually via YAML.

([@bdraco] - [#127668]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#127668]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/127668

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

Previously, Litter-Robot could have an off state. This has now changed to
`docked`, as¬†`off`¬†isn‚Äôt a valid state for¬†vacuum¬†entities.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#128297]) ([documentation](/integrations/litterrobot))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#128297]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128297

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Netatmo" %}

The preset modes of the thermostat have been renamed in order to support
translations `Schedule`, `Frost guard`, and `Manual` have been renamed to
`schedule`, `frost_guard`, and `manual`.

([@piitaya] - [#128890]) ([documentation](/integrations/netatmo))

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya
[#128890]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128890

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tibber" %}

The `tibber.get_prices` action has been adjusted to return datetimes as strings
instead of raw datetime objects.

Automations or template sensors using this may need to be modified with an
`as_datetime` filter. See our [templating documentation](/docs/configuration/templating/#time)
for more information on using these filters.

([@functionpointer] - [#123901]) ([documentation](/integrations/tibber))

[@functionpointer]: https://github.com/functionpointer
[#123901]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/123901

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Updates" %}

State attributes of update entities have been changed:

- The `in_progress` state attribute is now always a `bool`, never an integer.
- A new state attribute `update_percentage` has been added. The
  `update_percentage` is a number between 0-100 if an update is in progress
  and the entity supports reporting progress, or `None` if an update is not
  in progress or an update is in progress but the entity does not support
  reporting progress.

Scripts, automations, custom frontend components, etc., which consume the
`in_progress`¬†state attribute of update entities, need to be updated accordingly.

([@emontnemery] - [#128877]) ([documentation](/integrations/update))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#128877]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128877

{% enddetails %}

{% details "WMS WebControl pro" %}

The open/closed state of awnings will be inverted so that the UI visualization
and positioning match reality. This means open (100%) now refers to the awning
being completely retracted, and closed (0%) now means the awning is fully
expanded. This is not in line with industry terminology, but Home Assistant
does not yet natively support awnings of type patio.

([@mback2k] - [#128079]) ([documentation](/integrations/wmspro))

[@mback2k]: https://github.com/mback2k
[#128079]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/128079
