Last month the news broke that Athom, the makers of Homey, sold a majority stake of the company to LG for $60 million. Post-acquisition, I fear that Homey as we know it won't last very long.

> When a company has investors, like Athom did, their main goal is to get acquired or go public, as this allows them to deliver a return on investment. Despite any claims otherwise, the investors are always priority number one. When an acquisition happens, the investors and founders are the big winners, while users are left to hope that their devices won't change too much in the foreseeable future.

> **With the Open Home Foundation, we are playing a different game where the only winner is the user.**
